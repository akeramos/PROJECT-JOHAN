## 🧩 Shared item consist of:
Frontend for web app + JS backend  
- ⚙️ All function included in the shared code:  
  - 🧮 Auto calculated data

  - 🧩 Risk Categorization  
  - ➕ Others

- 🏥 Same frontend with Klinik Kesihatan selection at bottom — sends collected data to different database  
- 📝 Nama? **TBD**  
- 🌍 Future: include all 100+ Klinik Kesihatan  
- ❗ **etc:** ![tak ingat kena recall](https://img.shields.io/badge/tak_ingat_kena_recall-FF0000?style=flat-square)
